## <span color="red">NOTE: Classes cancelled from Week 03 onwards because no students enrolled.</span>

All of my class work will be uploaded here.

This repo will include:
* all additional notes and examples presented during my classes,
* any partial or fully worked tutorial, textbook, etc questions during my classes,
* hints, tips, information ... given in my classes,
* etc.

### Contact info:
* CC: Dr. Jacqueline Jarvis, Brisbane Campus, Contact: +61-07-3023-4238, Email: j.jarvis@cqu.edu.au
* Rocky Tutor: Mike O, email: m.omalley@cqu.edu.au

### Golden Rules for Success:
* This is a programming course, the emphasis is on you doing lots of programming, exploring a wide range of problems, writing lots of code to ensure you understand all of the course topics, and keeping up with the work each week.
* The student study requirement for this course is **12 hours per week minimum**: most of this time should be spent writing code to solve problems and explore the course topics.
* If you are struggling or fall behind, you may need to do a more than 12 hours per week.
* Start work on Assignments **at least 3 weeks prior to the due date.**
* Ensure the required course software (Java SDK, Netbeans, etc) is installed and you get the practice you need to become comfortable with this as soon as possible. Hint: Week 1.

### Need help:
* Course forums for all tutorial question and course / topic related questions.
* Contact the CC directly if you need help on your assignment.
* NOTE: Mike O is employed by CQUni for 2 hours per week ONLY - for the tutorial class.
* I can answer quick questions via email, but long / involved questions should be asked on the course forums or in class.
